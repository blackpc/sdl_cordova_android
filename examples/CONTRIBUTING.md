# Contributing to sdl_cordova_android

Third party contributions are essential for making this repository great. However, we do have a few guidelines we need contributors to follow.

### Gitflow
We use Gitflow as our branch management system. Please read up on it [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). The main points you should know are:

* All feature branches should be based on `develop` and have the format `feature/branch_name`.
* Minor bug fixes should be based on `master` and have the format `hotfix/branch_name`.
* All pull requests should involve a single change. Pull Requests that involve multiple changes (it is our discretion what precisely this means) will be rejected with a reason.
* All commits should involve logical units. Please do not put all changed code in one commit, unless it is a very minor change.
* Work in progress pull requests should have "[WIP]" in front of the Pull Request title. When you are ready to merge, remove this tag and @mention `smartdevicelink/developers` to get it scheduled for review.
* If applicable, follow [this Pull Request's format](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/SmartDeviceLink-iOS/pull/45).
* Please document all code written. Write [JavaDoc/ style documentation](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/index-137868.html) or [Objective-C] (http://nshipster.com/documentation/) for methods, and use inline code comments where it makes sense, i.e. for non-obvious code chunks.
