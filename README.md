# SmartDeviceLink Cordova Plugin (sdl_cordova)
===================================================================

## Introduction

The SmartDeviceLink Cordova Plugin was written to enable HTML/JavaScript based apps to access the vehicleÎéÎ÷s HMI via SmartDeviceLink. This is achieved using the Apache Cordova library, which translates messages passed into its JavaScript API into a variety of corresponding native language libraries. The SmartDeviceLink Cordova Plugin, SDLCordova, is a plugin that works in conjunction with the Cordova library. This plugin has been developed to expose the platform specific classes necessary for interaction with SmartDeviceLink to the JavaScript layer of a Hybrid Mobile Application. SDLCordova Plugin has been written to work on Android and iOS platforms.

While the development requires a native app container written for each targeted native platform, all of the business logic of the app can be contained in JavaScript, thus only very basic native platform development skills are required.
